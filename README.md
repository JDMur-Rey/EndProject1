This repo has the code for the Client creation webpage as well as the Meeting creation webpage including HTML and CSS (JS is in the HTML file). There is also an Angular project in this repo that is for both web pages mentioned above with components that share the HTML and CSS for said web pages. If you're looking for the scripts for the MYSQL database it's in the Angular projects with their respective names.
